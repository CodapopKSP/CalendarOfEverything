Assuming these are all accurate, then the Darian calendar should be correct.\n\nThere is one more stipulation that the current calendar is only perfectly accurate between the years 0 and 2000 due to the shortening of the Martian equinox year. Whether those are Martian years or Earth years isn't clear, but the difference is rather small and is currently ignored for this calendar.`,

Unfortunately it also must be calculated several times due to the nature of lunar calendars, though the date shown here is resused when possible.
